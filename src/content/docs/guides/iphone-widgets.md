You can also add Stardate to your lock screen or control center to quickly start a new note from your iPhone. The "New Entry" widget opens the Stardate app and starts a new note automatically.

This document will show you what that looks like, and link to Apple's documentation on how to add these features to your iPhone.

## Lock Screen Widgets
