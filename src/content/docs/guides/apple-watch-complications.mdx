Once you've installed Stardate on your Apple Watch, you can add a little icon– called a complication –to your watch face to start a note with one tap.

Not all watch faces support complications. Stardate supports two complication types:

- **Circular** – appears in the center of the watch face.
- **Corner** – appears in one of the four corners of the watch face.

You'll need to choose a watch face that supports one of those types of complications.

## Add a complication from your phone

1. On your iPhone, open the Watch app.
2. Tap the My Watch tab.
3. Select a watch face you want to add the complication to.
4. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see options to add complications. Different watch faces support different complications.
5. Choose a complication location and search or scroll to Stardate. Select the "New Stardate Entry" complication.
