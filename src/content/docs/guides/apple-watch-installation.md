Once you've installed Stardate on your iPhone, you'll need to confirm that it's installed on your Apple Watch. It should be installed automatically, but you can also check in the Watch app on your iPhone if it's not showing up.

1. On your iPhone, open the Watch app.
2. Tap the My Watch tab.
3. Scroll to the app that you want to add. Apps that you can install appear in the Available Apps section.

Apple has further documentation on [installing apps on Apple Watch here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109023).
