Once you've installed Stardate on your iPhone, you'll need to confirm that it's installed on your Apple Watch. It should be installed automatically, but you can also check in the Watch app on your iPhone if it's not showing up.

If the app is available but not installed on your Apple Watch, you may see an "INSTALL" button instead. Tap the Install button to add Stardate to your Apple Watch.
