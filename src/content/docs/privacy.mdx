description: Privacy policy for Stardate.

Stardate is built to be a private app. Your notes and audio recordings are yours alone. I feel strongly that you should own and control your own data.

My second objective is to make your data accessible to you. I aim to do this by providing a simple way to export your data and use it elsewhere.

### Files

Audio recordings are transcribed and stored in your iCloud Drive and on your device. Stardate creates two files:

1. A WAV file of the audio recording.
2. A text file of the transcription.

You can access these files in your iCloud Drive on iOS or macOS.

### Analytics and Usage data

Stardate does collect usage data to help us understand how the app is used and to identify issues. This data is collected anonymously and is not tied to your personal information. Currently, this data is collected through Google Analytics.

If you want to be able to opt out of this, please email me at [dean@stardateapp.com](mailto:dean@stardateapp.com). I am considering adding an opt-out setting to the app, but I have not implemented it yet.
