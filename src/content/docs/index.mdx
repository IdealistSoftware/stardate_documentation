# What do people use Stardate for?

People are already using Stardate for all sorts of things. Here are just a few examples:

- Remembering names of people you meet.
- Taking notes while reading a book.
- Capturing that "tip of your tongue" idea.
- Keeping track of your puppy's weight.
- Making sure you ask the doctor about that weird rash.
- Reminding yourself if you've taken your medication.
- Noting the cross streets of interesting neighborhoods.
- Debriefing after a promising date.

# Where we're going

Stardate is not just a note taking app. It will also be the way you talk to your personal AI. But unlike other AI apps, I believe you should run and own your own AI. Don't rent it from someone else.

Here's an eventual roadmap of what I'd like Stardate to do:

- Automatic note tagging and categorization
- Calendar integration
- To do and reminder integration
- Chart generation for data points
- Integrate with Zapier
- Email notes
- Export to Obsidian or other apps

## Frequently asked questions

**What's up with the puppet?**

I made "Lil Dean" for a Halloween costume a couple years ago. When I needed to make a demo video for Stardate, I thought it would be funny if the puppet was the spokesperson. Plus, then I didn't have to get a haircut.

The puppet is not in the app.

**Why call it Stardate?**

In sci-fi movies, when the captain is recording their log on the computer, they're always saying "Stardate 1234.56". Just seemed cool!
